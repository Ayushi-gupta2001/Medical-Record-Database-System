###Instructions
Basic site layout can be found in the **site** folder. There are three main folders to work on: **user, doctor and pharmacist**. Teams can add their files to the corresponding folders. Full site for references can be found in **site/sample** folder. You can use the elements from the sample sites like forms, tables, panel, buttons etc or you can search the web for bootstrap elements for front end development. Try to avoid changing the css files in **site/css directory**, this may distort other pages.
